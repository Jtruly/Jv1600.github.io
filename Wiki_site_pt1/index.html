        <i><p>Eren Yeager (Japanese: エレン・イェーガー, Hepburn: Eren Yēgā), named Eren Jaeger (Turkish: Eren, "Saint"; German: Jaeger/Jäger, "Hunter") in the subtitled and dubbed versions of the anime Attack on Titan, is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Attack on Titan manga series created by Hajime Isayama. Eren is a teenager who swears revenge on enormous humanoid creatures known as Titans that devoured his mother and destroyed his town in the Shiganshina district in Wall Maria. In order to defeat the Titans, Eren enlists in the Military and joins the Survey Corps—an elite group of soldiers who fight Titans outside the walls and also study the physiology of Titans in order to know what they are fighting. As the story progresses, Eren gains the power of becoming a Titan later identified as "Attack Titan" (進撃の巨人, Shingeki no Kyojin). He has also appeared in other related media including anime and video game.

        <h3>The Mangaka Artist</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Takanori_Gomi.jpg"></img>
        <p><b>Isayama</b> created Eren with the idea of a character whose fears and dreams were relatable but often clashed with his own darkness, resulting into multiple changes to his characterization. In the anime adaptation of the series, Eren has been voiced by Yūki Kaji in Japanese and Bryce Papenbrook in English. Both of these actors found difficulties in employing different types of voices based on how Eren grows up across the narrative. In the live-action film adaptations, he is portrayed by Haruma Miura & Ryota Ozawa.</p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>Isayama stated that Eren's wish to go outside the city's walls is similar to his own. When he was a child: He lived in a rural Japanese town surrounded by mountains. One day, he wanted to go beyond the mountains, which reflected in the town surrounded by walls in the manga where Eren lived in the series' beginning.[5] In retrospect, Isayama believes Eren fits the type of narrative he wrote for Attack on Titan, something that Isayama managed to relate with.[6]
